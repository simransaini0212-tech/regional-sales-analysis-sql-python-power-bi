## Oerview

This project analyzed regional sales performance and market trends through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights for strategic decisions in marketing, pricing, and inventory management. A complete data pipeline was developed using SQL for ETL, Python for EDA , and Power BI for interactive visualization and reporting.


## Business Problem

Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. This project aims to analyse and visualize regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.

What’s the Business Question?

- Inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions

- Lack of visibility into seasonal swings, top SKUs, and channel profitability

- Goal: Leverage 5 years of historical data to pinpoint growth levers and optimize strategy


## Tools & Technologies

- SQL  (Common table analysis, Filtering, Joins)
- Python (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn)

- Power BI  (Interactive Visualization)

- Github


## Exploratory Data Analysis EDA

Uncovering patterns, trends, and business insights from historical data !

- Understanding the “What, Where & Why” behind the sales numbers

- Exploring data through visuals, aggregations, and comparisons

- Laying the groundwork for informed recommendations


## Research Questions & Key Findings

- **Pronounced Seasonality**: January revenues average $124 M, dipping to $95 M in April.

- **SKU Concentration**: Products 26 & 25 together drive ~25 % of total sales.

- **Channel Trade‑Off**: Wholesale captures 54 % of volume; Export leads with ~38 % average margin.

- **Geographic Dominance**: California alone logs 7.6K orders ($230 M); the West region shows the largest swings.

- Aibox Company and State Ltd are the most valuable customers in terms of Revenue.

## Final & Reccomendation

- Seasonal Promotions: Launch recovery campaigns in April and amplify January offers to smooth revenue swings.

- SKU Optimization: Double down on top products 26 & 25 and re-evaluate pricing or phase out low‑margin SKUs.

- Channel Expansion: Incentivize Export partnerships for high margins and introduce volume deals in Wholesale.

- Regional Investment: Replicate California’s success in other regions and boost marketing in the Northeast & Midwest.

- Margin Monitoring: Flag orders below 80 % margin and analyse cost drivers to uplift underperforming segments.
